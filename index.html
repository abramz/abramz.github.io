				<p>I love to cook. Baking, grilling, roasting, saut√©ing, all of it. One reason that I love cooking is the combination of science (chemistry) and art. It is an outlet that I can use to flex my creative muscle while following a plan. I think there are a lot of similarities between software development and cooking. We have the science, standards, and best practices, but we also have the ability to be creative; we can riff off the standard way of doing things like we can riff off a recipe. This often leads to something new and not always expected; that novelty of experimentation is what I love most about both cooking and software development.</p>

					<span class="mega-octicon octicon-mark-github"></span></a></h4>
				<p>Short Url is a simple URL shortener. It contains three components:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>The <b>Front End</b> is pretty simple, one HTML page and a few lines of JavaScript. It can be hooked up to <a href="https://travis-ci.org">travis-ci</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/">Google Cloud Storage</a>. This allows successful builds to be deployed to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage. I use <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a> to run tasks, including unit tests. That means, that the code is tested on travis-ci before deployment.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The <b>API</b> is a <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a> application that stores/retrieves long URLs in a MySQL database. I use <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js</a> to run an API that will:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>"shorten" a long URL that is POSTed to '/'</li>
							<li>returns a long URL that is GETed to '/s'</li>
						</ul>
						<p>I use mocha to run unit tests, and have a Docker file so that the API can run in a container. The API can be hooked up to <a href="https://travis-ci.org">travis-ci</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/">Google Container Engine</a>. I can run tests with <a href="https://mochajs.org/">mocha</a>, so that code is tested before deployment. On a sucessful build of the master branch, an updated image, identified by the build id, is sent to the Google Container Registry. Then, a rolling update is run on a Google Container Cluster.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The <b>Proxy</b> is an <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">nginx</a> reverse proxy that:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>sends GET requests to '/', to the Google Cloud Storage bucket containing the front end</li>
								<li>sends all other requests to the API running in a Google Container Cluster</li>
							</ul>
						<p>While there are no tests for the proxy, when a check-in is made to the master branch, a <a href="https://travis-ci.org">travis-ci</a> build does kick off, and if the <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> image can be built, it has the same deployment scheme as the API.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

					<span class="mega-octicon octicon-mark-github"></span></a></h4>

					<p>gulp-render-react is a plugin for the popular Node.js build system, <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp.js</a>. I created this plugin so that I could pre-render <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> components in the build process. I wanted to do this to decrease initial load time of static web applications.</p>
