<h4><a href="https://github.com/riot-api-challenge/api-challenge">Patch Diff - Riot API Challenge 2.0</a></h2>
<p>For Riot's API Challenge 2.0, I am working with <a href="https://github.com/SmoshySmosh">Ethan Pursley</a> to develop a website that displays differences between League of Legends' patches 5.11 and 5.14. With the releases of patches 5.12, 5.13, and 5.14, a series of changes were made to the AP (ability power) items in the game. For the challenge, Riot made available 200,000 match identifiers each from before these changes (5.11) and after these changes (5.14). Using their API we have been able to retrieve detailed information about these matches, and aggregate statistics about champions. We will then present these in the website</p>
<p>We are using node.js to crawl the Riot API for match information. We are storing the matches in MongoDB, and use MongoDB's aggregation framework to gather champion statistics. We store the champion statistics in Firebase so that we do not require an API ourselves. Our back end is an Nginx reverse proxy running in Docker containers on AWS. We reverse proxy requests to the static Riot API for champion details, to Riot's Data Dragon for assests such as images, and to S3 which is where we store our front end. Finally, our front-end is an AngularJS web application.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/abramz/gulp-render-react">gulp-render-react</a></h2>
<p>gulp-render-react is a plugin for the popular Node.js build system, <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp.js</a>. I created this plugin so that I could use it in the 2015 <a href="http://www.staticshowdown.com/">Static Showdown</a>. I used the plugin so that I could pre-render <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> components in the build process. I wanted to do this to decrease initial load time of the static web application I created for the hackathon. After the Static Showdown was over, I forgot about gulp-render-react, until recently. The plugin is currently up to date and on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-render-react">npm</a>, but there are a few things I have in mind to improve it and make it more useful for a wider audience.</p>
