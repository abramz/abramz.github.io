<h3>Current Open Source Projects</h3>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/abramz/lol-crawler">lol-crawler</a></h2>
<p>lol-crawler is in the early stages of development. The plan is to create a program that will utilize the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods">Riot API for League of Legends</a> in order to get match data for Challenger & Master tier players and teams. Once historical match data has been secured, and a pattern for retrieving new match data is established, I will be able to analyze it for patterns in champion item builds, masteries, and runes, as a start. With the latest release of the Riot API (as of August 2015), there are many more possible use cases for this data. lol-crawler is written completly in JavaScript and runs on Node.js.</p>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/abramz/gulp-render-react">gulp-react-render</a></h2>
<p>gulp-render-react is a plugin for the popular Node.js build system, <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp.js</a>. I created this plugin so that I could use it in the 2015 <a href="http://www.staticshowdown.com/">Static Showdown</a>. I used the plugin so that I could pre-render <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> components in the build process. I wanted to do this to decrease initial load time of the static web application I created for the hackathon. After the Static Showdown was over, I forgot about gulp-react-render, until recently. The plugin is currently up to date and on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-render-react">npm</a>, but there are a few things I have in mind to improve it and make it more useful for a wider audience.</p>
